## 📝Description
Our inspiration for this app has come from an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUovEL4iT8s) of Shark Tank Season 1

In this episode Altor Helmets have created a helmet where the helmet which would detect bike accidents and would inform the guardians about the riders accident

We were really inspired by this concept and worked on the 2 major disadvantages of Altor Helmets

1. Altor Helmets are costly and are madatory for their app to work 
2. It would only detect accidents only when the rider wears the helmet and valid only for 2 wheelers

In India alone 1130 accidents occur in a day out of which 442 die out of which 60-65% victims die due to late help. The main objective of our app is to eliminate this delay of help. The user would enter his guardian's details and when the app detects an accident it will send you a notification asking if you're okay or not and if you don't nullify within a fixed amount a message would be sent to your guardian along with your location 

We worked on the problems of Altor Helmet and have improved the safety system

So how did we solve the problems faced by Altor Helmets?

* We have used sensors in phone do detect accidents and eliminating the cost of hardware/helmets
* Due to detection of accident using helmets it is limited only to 2 wheelers, by using our app we have increased its usecase to almost every vehicle

## 📈Progress

List down all the fully implemented features in your project

- [x] Accident Detection using Accelration
- [x] Accident Detection using Noise meter
- [x] Notification with time for nullifying 
- [x] Sms to guardians with location 



List down all the partially implemented features in your project

- [ ] Bluetooth calling 
- [ ] Last known location in case of a destroyrd phone

## 🔮Future Scope


- With more development in app we can have different speed limits for different kinds of vehicle to improve the accuracy of the accident detection
- In case of the guardian recieving the sms of security an access of front and rear camera can be sent to the guardian for him to see whether the rider is safe or not
- An automatic switch can be kept for when the app detects the high speed travel of the vehicle

## 💸Applications

>Our App would not stop accidents but would definitely speed up the process of the help recevied by the victims.
Our app can be used with any vehicle ensuring an all round safety. It can be monetized with 2 methods.
- A monthly charge based subscription model 
- Basic funtion to be kept as free but advance features like pictures through front and rear camera, bluetooth calling in case of accidents as an feature for paid users
## 🛠Project Setup

> 1. Git clone our project file 

> 2. Run our project file on Android Studio or VS Code

> 3. Set Up an emulator or and physical device 

> 4. Go to main.dart and press run 
## 💻Usage

>Complete the Sign Up and add your guardian details 

> Go to the home page and switch on the Suraksha Mode

> Once you're done with it whenever you face any sort of accident or the app judges that you have crashed it will send a notification to your with a countdown for you to nullify it 

>If you don't nullify the action then an emergency message is sent to your emergency contact along with your location for them to understand that you need help and can reach to you as soon as possible
